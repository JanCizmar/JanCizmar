### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jan; I live in Czechia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿, and I am the technical founder of Tolgee[https://tolgee.io]. I founded Tolgee in March 2021 to deliver simple & developer-friendly open-source localization software.

Iâ€™ve been playing around with software development since I was 13. Since then, I have been very passionate about it. Currently, I am focusing on development in strictly typed languages like Java or Typescript as I find it the most responsible way to develop a sustainable and scalable codebase. I like to find ways to keep code clean and without boilerplate duplicities. I hate being a copy-pasting monkey. ðŸ™ˆ

If you want to support us[https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-platform], your :star: would make Tolgee shine!
